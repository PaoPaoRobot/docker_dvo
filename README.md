# Dense Visual Odometry (dvo)

These packages provide an implementation of the rigid body motion estimation of an RGB-D camera from consecutive images.

 *  **dvo_core**
    
    Core implementation of the motion estimation algorithm. 
    
 *  **dvo_ros**
    
    Integration of *dvo_core* with ROS.
    
 *  **dvo_benchmark**
    
    Integration of *dvo_core* with TUM RGB-D benchmark, see http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset.
    
 *  **sophus**
    
    ROS package wrapper for Hauke Strasdat's Sophus library, see https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus.
    

## Usage

You can use my docker image
```bash
docker pull paopaorobot/dvo
```
---

You need mount your data to docker container, you can download TUM data from [here](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download)

Before the next step, you need get the `assoc.txt` file by run:
```bash
python2 associate.py rgb.txt depth.txt >> assoc.txt
```
Then, you can run
```bash
docker run -i -t -p 5900:5900 -e RESOLUTION=[width]x[hight] -v [data_path]:[docker_data_path] paopaorobot/dvo
```
e.g.
```bash
docker run -i -t -p 5900:5900 -e RESOLUTION=1920x1080 -v /home/cwang/data/TUM/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_360:/root/dataset paopaorobot/dvo
```
and input `:5900` in vnc viewer to connect the desktop

---

you can run in the desktop:
```bash
roslaunch dvo_benchmark benchmark.launch dataset:=[docker_data_path]
```
e.g.
```bash
roslaunch dvo_benchmark benchmark.launch dataset:=/root/dataset/
```

Maybe you cannot see anything now, the key `r` need to be pressed. Now you can see the groudtruth. If you want to estimation the trajectory, the key `p` need to be pressed. Now you can see trajecoties in the window. After all, you will find the result in `/root/fuerte_workspace/dvo/dvo_benchmark/output`
